According to Dan Brown (2006), “History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?”[@brown2006da].

Alligators have existed for over 150 million years, surviving through the dinosaur extinction [^1].

[^1]: Alligators are considered living fossils due to their ancient lineage.
